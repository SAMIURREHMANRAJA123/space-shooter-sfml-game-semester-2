The Space Shooter project is an exciting 2D game developed using the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) in C++. In this game, players control a spaceship navigating through space, dodging
asteroids, and shooting down enemy ships. The game features smooth animations, responsive controls, and an engaging user interface. It includes various levels of increasing difficulty, power-ups,
and a scoring system to keep players challenged and entertained. This project demonstrates my proficiency in C++ programming, game development, and the use of SFML for creating interactive
multimedia applications.
